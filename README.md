HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS EDA

üìä Project Overview

Goal: Explore long-term mortality trends (1991‚Äì2021), highlight demographic and cancer-site patterns, and surface insights for prevention and early detection.

Scope: National-level mortality by year, age group, race, sex, and leading cancer site (U.S., excluding Puerto Rico).

Outputs: Tableau visualizations + concise recommendations for policy and research.

üßæ Data

Source: CDC WONDER ‚Äì Cancer Mortality (1991‚Äì2021).

Quality checks: No nulls, no duplicates; no cleaning required before analysis.

Key fields: Year, Age Group, Race, Sex, Leading Cancer Site.

üîç Methods

Exploration: Python for basic validation; Tableau for visual EDA.

Visuals: 6+ Tableau dashboards on trends, leading sites, demographic splits, and age-specific patterns.

Recommendations: 5 targeted actions supporting early detection and monitoring emerging risks.

üö© Key Findings (High-Level)

Overall decline in cancer death rates since the 1990s; stabilization in recent years.

Lung & bronchus remains the top cause of cancer deaths; sharp declines since ~2006 align with reduced smoking.

Pancreatic cancer shows rising mortality; warrants closer monitoring and research investment.

Sex differences: Mortality higher among males than females.

Age pattern: Mortality peaks in senior age groups; notable female patterns in advanced age for pancreatic cancer.

Racial patterns: Leading cancer sites are broadly similar across races; majority of records are White, with limited data for Asians and Native Americans (interpret with care).

‚úÖ Recommendations (Summary)

Maintain focus on lung cancer prevention and cessation programs.

Elevate pancreatic cancer surveillance, funding, and early detection research.

Tailor age-specific screening and outreach strategies.

Expand equity-focused data collection and outreach where data is sparse.

Continue investing in early detection technologies and awareness campaigns.
